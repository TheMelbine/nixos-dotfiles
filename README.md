# üóí About

>I started using NixOS about a month ago. The main goal of this repository is to create the most modal and logical system possible. I'm tired of complex systems that take days to figure out. This repository is primarily for myself, but I don't mind if others use it as well.

> [!Warning]  
> These dotfiles are still under development. If anyone wishes to use them, please do so at your own risk.
